## What is it?

**SwiftGradients** gives you useful extensions for UIViews and CALayer classes to add beautiful color gradients.

## Installation

#### 1. Cocoapods

```ruby

pod 'SwiftGradients', '~> 1.0.0'

```

#### 2. Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.
Add the following line to your `Cartfile` and follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).

```
github "rootstrap/SwiftGradients" ~> 1.0.0
```

#### 3. Swift Package Manager

- In XCode 11, go to File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency.
- Enter the repo URL (https://github.com/rootstrap/SwiftGradients) and click Next.
- Select the version rule desired (you can specify a version number, branch or commit) and click Next.
- Finally, select the target where you want to use the framework.

That should be it. **SwiftGradients** should appear in the navigation panel as a dependency and the framework will be linked automatically to your target.


**Note:** It is always recommended to lock your external libraries to a specific version.
